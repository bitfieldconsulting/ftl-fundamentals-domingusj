Let's make sure our Go environment is set up and everything is working right. In this directory, run the command:

```
go test
```

If everything is good, we will see this output:

```
PASS
ok      hello   0.186s
```

This tells us that all the tests passed in the package called `hello`, and that running them took 0.186 seconds. (The exact time can vary.)

Nice job! Go on to the next exercise.
